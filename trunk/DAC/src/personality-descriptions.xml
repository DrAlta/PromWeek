	<character name="Edward" faction="Goth">

	<character name="Bruce" faction="Goth">
		<bio>Bruce started out high school as a popular football player, even starting on the JV for a few games.  However, during his sophomore year, some extra curricular reading (Dostoyevsky) made him realize how futile his former ambitions were.  He has since found a home in the Goth community, though he still craves the respect he had as a macho athelete.</bio>

	<character name="Lily" faction="Emo">
		<bio>Lily's older sister introduced her to pop music when she was in elementary school.  She quickly grew tired of the 'N Syncs and Jay-Zs, but her love of music drew her to the much deeper Death Cab for Cuties and Bright Eyes.  Her greatest hope is to one day go out with the lead singer of a band, or maybe the lead guitarist.</bio>

	<character name="Robert" faction="Emo">
		<bio>Robert longs for better days, when music wasn't so produced, when people were free to wear their hair and makeup as they chose, when black was again on the rise.  Robert longs for the 80s.  But having little hope for their return, Robert just wishes he could find a girl that could understand him.</bio>

	<character name="Karen" faction="Emo">
		<bio>Wildly independent since she was just a baby, Karen just loves to let loose and dance.  Generally, other people don't interest her, and she has no qualms letting them know it.  While she would never admit to liking her music, Joan Jett's attitude makes her Karen's secret hero.</bio>
