<!--
Final exams? Child's play. Simon's 
Simon always hits up the corner store on his way home from school for brain food (carrots and Cheeseytoos) but today he's lost his appetite: Prom is only one day away! As usual, some of the popular girls are hanging around outside. This might be his last chance to impress them before the big night.
The. Prom. Everything Simon has worked for is culminating here, tonight. Will Simon come out on top? Will the students respect him as more than just a braniac? Or will he be left alone on the dance floor with only the glow of his smartphone for company?
