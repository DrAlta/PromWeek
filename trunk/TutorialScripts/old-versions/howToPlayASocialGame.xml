Some notes on writing tutorial scripts:
object: This is the name of the object or UI element that you want the user to click on.  For the full list of objects, see the 'fillComponentDictionary' function of Tutorial.mxml.  Not every object is currently supported.  If you see something you want, you can add it yourself by simply adding the component to the fillComponentDictionary function.  Or e-mail Ben and he'll do it for you!  Leave it blank if you just want to present information, and have the user progress the tutorial by pushing next.
name: some objects require more specification (e.g. avatars).  To specify which avatar you care about, use the name field. (e.g. object='avatar', name='zack')
eventType: "click" or "over".  Click means you click on the object, over means you highlight your mouse over it.  More events can be added as well, though you should probably ask Ben to add it for you.
preText: This is text that shows up BEFORE you do the event.  I.e. the contents of this text should tell you WHAT to click on "e.g. click on Zack!"
postText: DEPRECATED The contents of this text shows up AFTER you do the event (e.g. 'good job, you just clicked on Zack!").  This doesn't work quite as well as it used to.  The new recommended way to do this is to introduce a new tutorial step that just has a blank 'object'
disableExceptions: Normally, everything EXCEPT for the object specified will be disabled, i.e. you won't be able to click on them.  However, there may be times when you DO want people to be able to click on a couple of things that aren't the specified thing to click on.  You can specify what those 'exceptions' are using this attribute.  Use the same names that you would put in the 'object' tag.  If you want to reference something that would use the name attribute, specify it with a hyphen between the object and the name (e.g. avatar-zack).  To specify multiple excpetions, specify them with a comma (e.g. avatar-zack,avatar-chloe,miniMapFriends).  Be careful about spaces i.e. dont use them!
nextVisible: if true, the 'progress tutorial' button will show up.  If false, it will not.  If the object is left blank, then make sure that this is set to true, or there is no way to progress the tutorial.

MAKING USE OF RICH TEXT:
-If you want to do special things like have differently colored text, or to have pictures appear in the middle of the text, you'll need to embed the sentence in a paragraph tag.  Due to the nature of mxml, you'll have to escape the angle brackets (less than sign and greater than sign) which looks pretty ugly.  It looks like this:
		OPENINING PARAGRAPH TAG: &lt;p&gt
		CLOSING PARAGRAPH TAG: &lt;/p&gt;
	You'll then have to use Span tags to actually do the effect that you want (change the color or have there be a picture).  See below.
	
TO HAVE SPECIAL COLORED TEXT: 
-place the text that you want to have be a special color within a 'span' tag.  Again, becuase we have to escape the opening and closing angle brackets, it looks a little weird.  For example, this write "this is green text" in the color Green, you would do the following:
		DIFFERENT COLOR EXAMPLE: &lt;span color='0x00FF00'&gt; this is green text &lt;/span&gt;

TO HAVE A PICTURE embedded in the text:
-Use span tags again, using one of a variety of special codes between the span tags. For some weird reason, in order for the span tags to be recognized, you need to specify their color attribute.  I dunno, it's weird.  I don't think the value of the color attribute matters. Be careful about spaces: there shouldn't be any!  New special codes can be added easily.  Contact Ben if the code you want isn't here.
		FRIENDSHIP SMILE FACE:  &lt;span color='0xFFFF00' &gt;FRIENDS&lt;/span&gt;
		DATING HEART:  &lt;span color='0xFFFF00' &gt;DATING&lt;/span&gt;
		ENEMY ANGRY FACE:  &lt;span color='0xFFFF00' &gt;ENEMIES&lt;/span&gt;
		END FRIENDSHIP: &lt;span color='0xFFFF00' &gt;ENDFRIENDS&lt;/span&gt;
		END DATING: &lt;span color='0xFFFF00' &gt;ENDDATING&lt;/span&gt;
		EMD ENEMIES: &lt;span color='0xFFFF00' &gt;ENDENEMIES&lt;/span&gt;
		JUICE POINT LOCK: &lt;span color='0xFFFF00' &gt;LOCK&lt;/span&gt;
