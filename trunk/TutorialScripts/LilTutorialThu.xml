<!--
Lil has always refused to be hammered into any square holes, but now that high school's almost over, her poser-hating, adorably/annoyingly mopey persona is about to have a violent confrontation with Real Life. Will she spend her last few days on a quest to go out with a bang? Change her attitude? Or change the people around her?

All anyone else can think about is writing something stupid in as many yearbooks as possible. Lil used hers to start a fire and now she's got more important things to do.
