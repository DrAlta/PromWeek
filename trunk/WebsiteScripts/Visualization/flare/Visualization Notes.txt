Visualization tool README!

Hello! And welcome to the super awesome PromWeekVisualizationTool!

To use this tool: 
1) Run it
2) Click "Select File" 
	Note: Your file must be formatted as such:
			> ID
			initiator,responder,social game,effectid
			initiator,responder,social game,effectid
			...
			...
			> ID
			initiator,responder,social game,effectid
			...
	The line "> ID" is a greater than symbol followed by their facebook id as a number
	each section is a level, and each individual social game is on it's own line.
3) Click "Load File"
4) Enjoy your trace! Please report any errors to the appropriate codemonkey

If you aren't a developer, you don't have to read this. But if you are, you're
awesome! Woot Tiger Team! (If you aren't a developer and you're reading this,
you are still awesome :D)


Things you should know for future development

*PromWeekVisTree.drawTree() is where the tree is drawn, and it returns a 
	Visualization object which should be used like so-
		someVisualElement.addChild(pwvt.drawTree())
	To use it in an MXML component- mx:SpriteVisualElement is a good start, 
	since it can have children

*Inside of drawTree, there is a group of Objects with variable names nodes, 
	childs, and edges. These are sort of "styles" for the tree. These are
	key to doing fancy things! I made a comment called "IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW".
	Hopefully no one has deleted it. If they have, look in PromWeekVisTree.drawTree()
	for lines that say "setProperties" or "setProperty". They show how to do fancy
	things that are required for advanced functionality.
	
*You're awesome :D

*Ben's Machine Learning project works brilliantly for generating games. Ask Ben or 
	Ryan how to use it.
